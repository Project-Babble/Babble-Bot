        "Content": "Babble supports the use of any USB camera, however you can also [DIY your own camera](https://docs.babble.diy/docs/hardware). The [**Babble store**](https://babble.diy/collections/all) has everything bundled for you in one nice place!\n\nThe camera we recommend the most is the [OV2640 **160° (850nm)**](https://www.aliexpress.com/i/3256802893361919.html).\nWe also recommend the [OV2640 **120°**](https://www.aliexpress.com/item/3256804729833235.html) as well as the [OV2640 **130°**](https://www.aliexpress.com/item/1005005224975454.html). Please note however, these cameras will require [the removal of the IR filter](https://youtu.be/QYH-FWvDbDc?si=li6NzNnGE_ke9QVV).\n\nYou will also require an **ESP32**. The [SeeedStudio XIAO ESP32-S3](https://seeedstudio.com/XIAO-ESP32S3-Sense-p-5639.html) is the smallest.\nIf you prefer alternative ESP32's, the [Freenove ESP32-S3](https://www.aliexpress.com/item/3256807112147121.html) is a great alternative, although a little larger.\n\nLastly, you will require some form of LED lighting to achive reliable tracking. If you are willing to DIY your own lamp, we reccomend the [LCSC unfocused IR LEDs](https://www.lcsc.com/product-detail/Infrared-IR-LEDs_XINGLIGHT-XL-3216HIRC-850_C965891.html) or the [EAST16084WA1 LEDs](https://www.digikey.com/en/products/detail/everlight-electronics-co-ltd/EAST16084WA1/11200896) (should you prefer visible light) alongside x2 [80Ω 1206 SMD resistors](https://www.digikey.com/en/products/detail/yageo/MFR-25FBF52-357R/12911).\nAlternatively if you do not wish to solder, this off the shelf [USB A 6000K LED lamp](https://www.aliexpress.com/item/1005005708678733.html) also works!\n\nFurther information as well as [mounts for commmon headsets](https://docs.babble.diy/docs/hardware/components/mounts) in our [hardware documentation.](https://docs.babble.diy/docs/hardware)"

        "Content": "To set up your camera in Babble, you will need to enter the correct serial (COM) or UVC (USB webcam) device.\nUsing the software [USBTreeView](https://www.uwe-sieber.de/files/UsbTreeView_x64.zip), search for the device `Espressif USB JTAG/ serial debug unit`. This will then be followed by `COM`. Enter this into the software i.e. `COM5`\n\nFor UVC cameras, set the address to `0` and incrementally increase until the correct camera is found. It may take a few seconds for babble to load the camera preview."
